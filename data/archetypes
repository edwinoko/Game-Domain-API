    Shoto
    Rushdown
    Grappler
    Half-grappler
    Heavyweight (not the same as grappler, specially if you're talking about platform fighters like Smash)
    Rekka
    Projectile zoner
    Normal zoner (yes there's a distinction between the two, and normal zoners tend to have a lesser range, being "half-zoners")
    Hybrid zoner (controversial on whether or not it's a real thing as the projectile part should override the definition as it's the one which decides the optimal range)
    Charge zoner/shoto (Guile/Vatista)
    Reversal-based
    Mixup
    Crossup
    Setplay
    Trapper
    Kamikaze (Like Carmine)
    Gimmick
    Summoner
    Glass cannon
    Glass tecnician (doesn't have the added damage of the glass cannon but compensates with versatility)
    Hit-n-run
    Mimicker
    Anti-zoner (generally only appears in team games as it would be unfair to have an unbalanced matchup by default but teams allowing that to not be a problem)
    Jack-of-all-trades
    Stance
    Healer
    Negative edge
    Mount (Can enter a mount, should be differentiated from normal stance characters since the mount has more movement implications while stance characters seem to mostly have the universal walking mechanics regardless of stance)
